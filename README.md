This is a carbon comparison game, built in a weekend at the Rewired State "[Carbon & Energy Hack Day](http://www.rewiredstate.org/events/carbon-and-energy)".

How well do you know the carbon impact of things? How many cups of coffee have same carbon impact as 1km of train travel? How well can you score?
