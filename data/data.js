E.g. Instead of \"times drying your hands\" which will become \"4 times drying your hands\", we could put \"drying your hands \u273a times\" which could then display \"drying your hands 4 times\". Similarly, \"4 times boiling 1 litre of water\" would be much better as \"Boiling \u273a litres of water\". As a bonus, if we sometimes don't use the placeholder in the symbol column, no number would be displayed, which would allow us to have \"boiling a litre of water\" rather than \"1 boil of a litre of water\" or \"boiling a litre of water 1 time\", neither of which are good.  /// PREM says: Sure. A common pattern for doing this would be to add a placeholder of \"%d\" (without the quotes) to the text where it needs to be replaced by a digit. /// BTW - please don't edit the column headers or the JavaScript will break.
